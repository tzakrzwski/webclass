	<h1>Top Ten Video Games<h1>

	<h2>#10: New Super Mario Bros. Wii</h2>
	<img src="images/supermario.jpg" alt="New Super Mario Bros">
	<p>Super Mario Bros Wii is basically a remake of the original NES game, but it upgrades to both the powers and graphics (of course). The reason that I like this game is me and my brothers used to spend hours on this game, trying to beat it.</p>

	<h2>#9: Putt Putt</h2>
	<img src="images/puttputt.png" alt="Putt Putt goes to the races">
	<p>Putt Putt is actually a series of games, but each game is about the same. Putt Putt is a point and click "adventure" game for Windows XP and it was the first video game that I played. As little as I came remember for my early years, I do remember playing this game all the time.</p>

	<h2>#8: Super Paper Mario</h2>
	<img src="images/papermario.png" alt="Super Paper Mario">
	<p>Super Paper Mario was a RPG-ish game for the Wii. This game was the first game that I played which was not straight forward and evolved advanced problem solving and puzzles, which is typical of RPGs. What made this game special for me was that it was so different that all the other Mario games that I had played and it had a sort of subtle humor to it</p>

	<h2>#7: Lego City Undercover</h2>
	<img src="images/legocity.jpg" alt="Lego City Undercover">
	<p>Lego City Undercover, a true RPG, is one of my favorites because of the vase open Lego world that can be explored and because of the extreme amount of collectables that can be collected. Also, this game was pretty much the GTA of Lego because you could take anyone’s car, destroy anything that moved, and even had to make missions to steal expensive items, but with no consequences because you are a cop.</p>

	<h2>#6: Wii sports</h2>
	<img src="images/wiisports.jpg" alt="Wii Sports Resort">
	<p>Wii sports was the tech demo of sorts that was came bundled with the Wii console. It was later fallowed by sequels, or sorts, with my favorite being Wii Sports Resort. The reason I liked this game is because it greatly untilled the motion controls of the Wii, making playing the game feel more real than simply hitting a button. Also, it was the first game that I got to play with my family, even before I owned a Wii.</p>

	<h2>#5: Minecraft</h2>
	<img src="images/minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft Logo">
	<p>Minecraft needs no explanation as it was one of the most popular games of the past so many years. While I have not ventured into this game for some time it still is one of my favorites, mostly for nostalgic reasons. I loved to play this game as a young lad; mining diamonds, building pointless structures and basically wasting my time away, striving for nothing but some for some self-motivated goal.</p>

	<h2>#4: Super Mario Galaxy</h2>
	<img src="images/mariogalaxy.jpg" alt="Super Mario Galaxy 2 Background">
	<p>Super Mario Galaxy and also Galaxy 2 (they are essentially the same) are 3D platformer games for the Wii. These game star everyone’s favorite Italian plumber as he travels to the stars to save the day. At this point in this list, if it is not apparent yet, I love Super Mario games and these two games are some of the. The platforming and the level design in these games where spot on and the sheer amount of content this game contained excites me now as it did when I first played it.</p>

	<h2>#3: Mario Kart</h2>
	<img src="images/mariokart.jpg" alt="Mario Kart Wii">
	<p>Mario Kart is a racing game which drops the hammer with Mario and Co. in well made, yet some times frustrating, race courses that will test your skills against your friends'. There is not a specific title in this series that I prefer over another. The main thing that puts this game here is that I, still to this day, I will play this game with others, mainly my brothers and we will still have as much fun throwing shells and bananas at each other as when we first got the game over 7 years ago.</p>

	<h2>#2: Super Smash Bros. Wii U</h2>
	<img src="images/smashbros.jpg" alt="SSB4 Art">
	<p>Super Smash Bros. is a fighting game in which you play as a character from Nintendo franchises and beat the life out of everyone else until you stand victorious. Honestly, I do not like fighting games for the most part, but his game is awesome. The reason I love this game is because every year since my brother got this game, me and my cousins play it for hours in our grandmother’s basement and man is it fun when you see your character appear on the screen as the victor. (Especially sense I always lose to my brothers)</p>

	<h2>#1: Super Mario Odyssey</h2>
	<img src="images/marioodyssey.jpg" alt="Super Mario Odyssey Box Art">
	<p>Super Mario Odyssey is a 3rd Action-adventure Platformer, but less in the vein of Galaxy and more like Super Mario 64. This game is incredible and has to be my favorite game. The levels, which are more like open worlds, are beautifully crafted and the design of this game is top-nocte. The controls of the game are flawless and the main game mechanic of possessing innocent creatures makes gameplay interesting and ever-changing. The best part of this game by far has to be the sheer amount of stuff there is to collect and the amount of environments there are to explore. I love this game and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Switch, even if they are not a Mario fan.</p>
